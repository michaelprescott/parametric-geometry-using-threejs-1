## You should now have two files: my-certificate-authority.key (your private key) and

#sudo security delete-certificate -c "<name of existing certificate>"

## Reference:
##sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain <certificate>

## Installing Your Root Certificate
## You will need to add the root certificate to any laptops, desktops,
## tablets, and phones that will be accessing your HTTPS sites.
## This can be a bit of a pain, but the good news is that we only have
## to do it once. Once our root certificate is on each device, it will
## be good until it expires.

## Adding the Root Certificate to macOS Keychain
## Open the macOS Keychain app
## Go to File > Import Items‚Ä¶
## Select your root certificate file (i.e. my-certificate-authority.pem)
## Search for whatever you answered as the Common Name name above

## Double click on your root certificate in the list
## Expand the Trust section
## Change the When using this certificate: select box to ‚ÄúAlways Trust‚Äù

## Close the certificate window
## It will ask you to enter your password (or scan your finger), do that
## üéâ Celebrate!
